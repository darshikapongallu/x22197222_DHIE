#### About the Application: 
In the evolving landscape of healthcare, safeguarding electronic health records (EHRs) has become crucial due to the rise in data breaches. This research presents a comprehensive solution that leverages advanced cryptographic techniques and blockchain technology to secure patient information. The framework is built upon the NTRU lattice-based cryptographic algorithm, known for its resistance to quantum attacks, ensuring a secure and quantum-resistant system. To enhance security and provide low-latency finality, Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) is utilized. Privacy is further protected through the implementation of zero-knowledge rollups on Polygon sidechains. To address issues of scalability, availability, and manageability, the integration of Kubernetes with blockchain platforms and cloud services facilitates powerful container orchestration. Compliance with HIPAA regulations is maintained by adhering to the Privacy Rule, Security Rule, Breach Notification Rule, and Enforcement Rule. Key strategies include utilizing off-chain storage for Protected Health Information (PHI), ensuring encrypted communication, and enforcing robust access controls. The cloud infrastructure supports secure, scalable, and efficient deployment, while cryptographic hashes and metadata are managed on the blockchain. This research significantly enhances the security and privacy of patient information, addressing a critical need in the healthcare sector.
